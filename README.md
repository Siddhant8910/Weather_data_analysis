# Weather Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a comprehensive weather dataset containing hourly observations from 2006 to 2016. The analysis focuses on understanding temperature trends, humidity patterns, and identifying anomalies in the meteorological data.

## Key Findings

### Temperature Analysis
- **Peak temperature**: 24.56°C occurred on 2012-07-31
- **Minimum temperature**: -5.14°C occurred on 2012-02-29
- Strong correlation (0.99) between temperature and apparent temperature

### Humidity Analysis
- **Peak humidity**: 0.93 occurred on 2015-12-31
- **Minimum humidity**: 0.49 occurred on 2007-07-31
- Negative correlation (-0.63) between temperature and humidity

### Anomalies Detected
- Temperature anomalies with high values on August 1, 2006
- Low temperature values on March 23, 2016
- Humidity irregularities during both high and low temperature periods
- Pressure sensor failures (zero values) on March 23, 2016

## Technical Implementation
The analysis was performed using:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for statistical calculations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization

## How to Use This Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter notebook `weather_analysis.ipynb`

## Files Included
- `weather.csv`: Original dataset
- `weather_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with complete analysis
- `README.md`: This documentation file

## Future Work
- Implement machine learning models for weather prediction
- Expand analysis to include seasonal patterns
- Develop automated anomaly detection system
